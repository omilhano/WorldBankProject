# Business Intelligence Project: World Bank Environmental Analysis

This repository contains the project work for the Business Intelligence course, focusing on analyzing environmental data from the World Bank. The goal of this project is to create a Power BI report that assesses the changes and effectiveness of regulatory measures aimed at improving the global environment.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to:

- Analyze environmental data from the World Bank.
- Identify key indicators related to environmental quality and regulations.
- Develop visualizations and insights using Power BI.
- Evaluate the impact and effectiveness of regulatory changes over time.
- Provide actionable recommendations for policymakers based on our analysis.

## Usage

The Power BI report provides interactive visualizations that allow users to:

- Explore environmental data trends over time.
- Compare regulatory changes across different regions and countries.
- Assess the effectiveness of environmental policies and regulations.
- Identify areas for further analysis or intervention.

The report includes the following tabs:

1. **Agricultural Methane Emissions**
2. **European Environmental Taxes**
3. **CO2 Emissions per Capita**
4. **PM 2.5 Concentration**

Feel free to navigate through these tabs to explore specific themes and datasets.
